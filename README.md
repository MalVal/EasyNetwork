# EasyNetwork

EasyNetwork is a Java library that simplifies network programming.

It provides wrapper classes around Java’s standard networking APIs (such as `Socket` and `ServerSocket`) to reduce boilerplate code and make client-server communication easier to implement.

The goal of this project is to offer a cleaner, more developer-friendly abstraction over low-level networking logic while keeping flexibility and performance.
